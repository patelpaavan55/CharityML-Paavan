## Getting Started

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Exploring the Data
Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

### Implementation: Data Exploration
A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
- The total number of records, `'n_records'`
- The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
- The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
- The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.

** HINT: ** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted. 


```python
# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = data.shape[0]

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = data.loc[data['income']=='>50K'].shape[0]

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = data.loc[data['income']=='<=50K'].shape[0]

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = (n_greater_50k / n_records ) * 100

# Print the results
print("Total number of records: {}".format(n_records))
print("Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k))
print("Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k))
print("Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {}%".format(greater_percent))
```

    Total number of records: 45222
    Individuals making more than $50,000: 11208
    Individuals making at most $50,000: 34014
    Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: 24.78439697492371%

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 

Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)
```


![png](output_12_0.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.

Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)
```


![png](output_14_0.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
```

### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.
 - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
   - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.


```python
def income_to_num(x):
    if x=='>50K':
        return 1
    if x=='<=50K':
        return 0
```


```python
# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.apply(income_to_num)

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print("{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded)))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
print(encoded)
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.
    ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week', 'workclass_ Federal-gov', 'workclass_ Local-gov', 'workclass_ Private', 'workclass_ Self-emp-inc', 'workclass_ Self-emp-not-inc', 'workclass_ State-gov', 'workclass_ Without-pay', 'education_level_ 10th', 'education_level_ 11th', 'education_level_ 12th', 'education_level_ 1st-4th', 'education_level_ 5th-6th', 'education_level_ 7th-8th', 'education_level_ 9th', 'education_level_ Assoc-acdm', 'education_level_ Assoc-voc', 'education_level_ Bachelors', 'education_level_ Doctorate', 'education_level_ HS-grad', 'education_level_ Masters', 'education_level_ Preschool', 'education_level_ Prof-school', 'education_level_ Some-college', 'marital-status_ Divorced', 'marital-status_ Married-AF-spouse', 'marital-status_ Married-civ-spouse', 'marital-status_ Married-spouse-absent', 'marital-status_ Never-married', 'marital-status_ Separated', 'marital-status_ Widowed', 'occupation_ Adm-clerical', 'occupation_ Armed-Forces', 'occupation_ Craft-repair', 'occupation_ Exec-managerial', 'occupation_ Farming-fishing', 'occupation_ Handlers-cleaners', 'occupation_ Machine-op-inspct', 'occupation_ Other-service', 'occupation_ Priv-house-serv', 'occupation_ Prof-specialty', 'occupation_ Protective-serv', 'occupation_ Sales', 'occupation_ Tech-support', 'occupation_ Transport-moving', 'relationship_ Husband', 'relationship_ Not-in-family', 'relationship_ Other-relative', 'relationship_ Own-child', 'relationship_ Unmarried', 'relationship_ Wife', 'race_ Amer-Indian-Eskimo', 'race_ Asian-Pac-Islander', 'race_ Black', 'race_ Other', 'race_ White', 'sex_ Female', 'sex_ Male', 'native-country_ Cambodia', 'native-country_ Canada', 'native-country_ China', 'native-country_ Columbia', 'native-country_ Cuba', 'native-country_ Dominican-Republic', 'native-country_ Ecuador', 'native-country_ El-Salvador', 'native-country_ England', 'native-country_ France', 'native-country_ Germany', 'native-country_ Greece', 'native-country_ Guatemala', 'native-country_ Haiti', 'native-country_ Holand-Netherlands', 'native-country_ Honduras', 'native-country_ Hong', 'native-country_ Hungary', 'native-country_ India', 'native-country_ Iran', 'native-country_ Ireland', 'native-country_ Italy', 'native-country_ Jamaica', 'native-country_ Japan', 'native-country_ Laos', 'native-country_ Mexico', 'native-country_ Nicaragua', 'native-country_ Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc)', 'native-country_ Peru', 'native-country_ Philippines', 'native-country_ Poland', 'native-country_ Portugal', 'native-country_ Puerto-Rico', 'native-country_ Scotland', 'native-country_ South', 'native-country_ Taiwan', 'native-country_ Thailand', 'native-country_ Trinadad&Tobago', 'native-country_ United-States', 'native-country_ Vietnam', 'native-country_ Yugoslavia']
    

### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.

Run the code cell below to perform this split.


```python
# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
#Changed it to model_selection to avoid deprecation warning

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print("Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0]))
print("Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0]))
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 


#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall

** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).

** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`

** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`

For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.

** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.

** HINT: ** 

* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.


```python
TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
# encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case

# TODO: Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
accuracy = TP / income.count()
recall = 1
precision = accuracy

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
beta = 0.5
betasq = beta * beta
fscore = ( (1+betasq) * precision * recall)/ ( (betasq * precision) + recall )

# Print the results 
print("Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore))
```

    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]
    

###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen

- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?

** HINT: **

Structure your answer in the same format as above^, with 4 parts for each of the three models you pick. Please include references with your answer.

**Answer: **

**1. Gaussian Naive Bayes**

   1) ***Real World Example***[1]
   
   Classify a person’s cognitive activity, based on brain image
        
        • reading a sentence or viewing a picture?
        
        • reading the word “Hammer” or “Apartment”
        
        • viewing a vertical or horizontal line?
        
        • answering the question, or getting confused?
        
   2) ***Strengths*** [3]:
   
   It's very simple and also if the NaiveBayes condition holds the classifier will converge quicker than other algorithms like Logistic Regression and even if the condition doesn't hold it still performs well.
    
   3) ***Weaknesses***[2]: 
   NaiveBayes models are often beaten by models properly trained and tuned using other algorithms.
     
   4) ***Reason***:
   
   The reasons for choosing this model based on characterstics of dataset are as follows:
   * The dataset contains more than 50 samples but less than 100K samples
   * Our dataset has labeled data, i.e. '>50k' or '<=50K'

    All the above characteristics indicate using Naive Bayes algorithm for training according to the machine learning map given by scikit-learn[6].

    Also we are unaware about the distribution of data points, so if the data is linearly separable, naive bayes will accurately separte the data. While i will choose the other two model such that they are good in separting non-linear data.

The reasons for choosing this model based on characterstics of model are as follows:
   * **Time**:
        It takes less training time, as it classfies based on a simple condition.
   * **Accuracy**:
        If the Naive Bayes condition holds it generally separates data efficiently but even if the condition doesn't hold up it still performs well.
   * **No of parameters**:
        As per my knowledge, there are no parameters required for this model

**2. Support Vector Machines **

1) ***Real World Example***[4]:

Handwriting Recognition - SVMs are widely used to recognize handwritten characters
        
2) ***Strengths***[2]:
           
SVM's can model non-linear decision boundaries. They are robust against overfitting even in high dimensional spaces.

3) ***Weaknesses***[2]:
           
It is memory intensive, difficult to tune and doesn't scale well to large dataset.

4) ***Reason***:
           
According to the machine learning map of scikit learn[6] discussed above SVC can also be used as an alternative.

Now, considering the model's charactestics which made me choose this model are as follows:
* **Linearity**:
This algorithm has an ability to perform well with non-linear classification problems and as there as a lot of features(103 after one hot encoding), there is a high possibilty that the problem goes in n dimensional plane.
* **No of Parameters**:
There are number of parameters to tune like kernels, C value, gamma value etc., but once we get to know the right parameters, it can greatly affect the accuracy of the model. And in order to tune the parameters we can use GridSearch.
* **Time**:
SVC's take a lot of time in training especially with large data, but still i chose this model beacuse i wanted to compare all performance from all  categories of models. Nd this model belongs to the one, which needs long training time but delivers high accuracy.
* **Accuracy**:
This provides accuracy but at the cost of training performance.

**3. Random Forests**

1) ***Real World Example***[5]
   
In Finance, it is used to determine a stock's behaviour in the future.

2) ***Strengths***[5]:
   
Random Forests are handy and easy to use. The default parameters often give a good prediction result and also the hyperparameters required is not that high. They prevent overfitting most of the time. It also helps to determine relative importance of features.

3) ***Weaknesses***[5]:
   
Large number of trees can make the algorithm slow. Therefore cannot be used in real-time predictions.

4) ***Reason***
              
The last alternative suggested by scikit learn[6] in their machine learning map for having characteristics as discussed above(in GNB), is *Ensemble methods* and Random Forest is one of the ensemble methods.

And based on the model's characteristics they are as follows:
* **Avoids Overfitting**:
These algorithm trains several smaller decision trees(weak learners) which are trained on limited knowledge. And then  these weak learners' output is combined(by averaging) to form a strong learner. This averaging helps the model to avoid overfitting over a large data as is the case in our dataset.
* **Linearity**:
This algorithm can classify non-linear datapoints which may be the case due to larger no. of features.
* **No of parameters**:
The model can be tuned according to a number of parameters such as no of estimators, criterion, maximum no of features etc.

### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
 - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
 - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
   - Record the total prediction time.
 - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
 - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!


```python
# TODO: Import two metrics from sklearn - fbeta_score and accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, accuracy_score
 
def train_predict(learner, sample_size, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
    '''
    inputs:
       - learner: the learning algorithm to be trained and predicted on
       - sample_size: the size of samples (number) to be drawn from training set
       - X_train: features training set
       - y_train: income training set
       - X_test: features testing set
       - y_test: income testing set
    '''
    
    results = {}
    
    # TODO: Fit the learner to the training data using slicing with 'sample_size' using .fit(training_features[:], training_labels[:])
    start = time() # Get start time
    learner = learner.fit(X_train[:sample_size],y_train[:sample_size])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the training time
    results['train_time'] = end - start
        
    # TODO: Get the predictions on the test set(X_test),
    #       then get predictions on the first 300 training samples(X_train) using .predict()
    start = time() # Get start time
    predictions_test = learner.predict(X_test)
    predictions_train = learner.predict(X_train[:300])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the total prediction time
    results['pred_time'] = end - start
            
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on the first 300 training samples which is y_train[:300]
    results['acc_train'] = accuracy_score(y_train[:300],predictions_train)
        
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on test set using accuracy_score()
    results['acc_test'] = accuracy_score(y_test,predictions_test)
    
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the the first 300 training samples using fbeta_score()
    results['f_train'] = fbeta_score(y_train[:300],predictions_train,beta=0.5)
        
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the test set which is y_test
    results['f_test'] = fbeta_score(y_test,predictions_test,beta=0.5)
       
    # Success
    print("{} trained on {} samples.".format(learner.__class__.__name__, sample_size))
        
    # Return the results
    return results
```

### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.

**Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# TODO: Initialize the three models
clf_A = GaussianNB()
clf_B = svm.SVC()
clf_C = RandomForestClassifier()

# TODO: Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
# HINT: samples_100 is the entire training set i.e. len(y_train)
# HINT: samples_10 is 10% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
# HINT: samples_1 is 1% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
samples_100 = len(y_train)
samples_10 = (int) (0.1*samples_100)
samples_1 = (int) (0.01*samples_100)

# Collect results on the learners
results = {}
for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:
    clf_name = clf.__class__.__name__
    results[clf_name] = {}
    for i, samples in enumerate([samples_1, samples_10, samples_100]):
        results[clf_name][i] = \
        train_predict(clf, samples, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Run metrics visualization for the three supervised learning models chosen
vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)
```

## Improving Results
In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model

* Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 

** HINT: ** 
Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the visualization created by `vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)`) and check the F score for the testing set when 100% of the training set is used. Which model has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the:
* metrics - F score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used, 
* prediction/training time
* the algorithm's suitability for the data.

**Answer: **

Out of the 3 models which are as follows:
1. GaussianNB
2. SVM
3. Random Forest

I believe **Random Forest** is the most appropriate model for identifying individuals that make more than $50,000 because of the following reasons:
* The Fscore for testing set with 100% training set clearly shows that both the **SVM classifier** as well as the **Random Forest** Classifier performed equally well with a score of around **0.7**
* But the reason to chose Random Forest over SVM is because the training time taken by SVM is above 200 seconds when 100% of the training set is used, which is significantly greater as compared to Random Forest which less than 1 second.

### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms

* In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.

** HINT: **

When explaining your model, if using external resources please include all citations.

**Answer: ** 

The model used is Random Forest. Before explaining what is a Random Forest, we will see what is a Decision Tree.
A decision tree is group of nodes where each node(parent node) splits into many nodes(child node) except for the nodes present at the end. The working of decision trees can be seen analogous to the famous game Twenty Questions. In the game, one player is chosen to be the answerer. That person chooses a subject (object) but does not reveal this to the others. All other players are questioners. They each take turns asking a question which can be answered with a simple "Yes" or "No." trying to guess the subject, the person has chosen.[1]

   In our case, the decision is made based on the number of hours per week, education level, marital status and many other features. And based on this it decides whether the individual is earning more than $50,000 or not. A Random Forest is just a bunch of such decision trees. Each tree, on it's own performs poorly. This can be seen in real life as a doctor would have good knowledge about medicine while on the other hand a civil engineer would have good knowledge about constuction of buildings but not medicine. But when both of their knowledge is combined. They can solve problems requiring knowledge of both disciplines. 

   Similarly, the poorly performing decision trees have limited knowledge and are called weak learners. And when these weak learners' results are combined by averaging, they form a strong learner. Every weak learner votes whether the individual earns more than 50k dollars or not, and based on the majority the final decision is taken. This is done for every individual row of the dataset(i.e. 36177 times to be precise when the 100% of the training set is used). This is how the training of random forest model is done.

For prediction these trained set of decision trees will be used, but the data on which prediction is made is the remaining rows of the data not used for training(i.e. 9045 rows).

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions

### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.

**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer,fbeta_score
# TODO: Initialize the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# TODO: Create the parameters list you wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# HINT: parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
parameters = {'n_estimators':[10,20,30,50],'criterion':('entropy','gini'),'max_features':['auto','log2',None]}

# TODO: Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score,beta=0.5)

# TODO: Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf,parameters,scoring=scorer)

# TODO: Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print("Unoptimized model\n------")
print("Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nOptimized Model\n------")
print("Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Unoptimized model
    ------
    Accuracy score on testing data: 0.8377
    F-score on testing data: 0.6715
    
    Optimized Model
    ------
    Final accuracy score on the testing data: 0.8463
    Final F-score on the testing data: 0.6888
    

### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation

* What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
* Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
* How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  

**Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

#### Results:

|     Metric     | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |            0.8377 |           0.8463|
| F-score        |            0.6715 |           0.6888|


**Answer: **

Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2971]
The optmized model's score are definetely better than the unoptimized RF model. The parameter set in the optimized model are as follows:
* criterion = 'entropy'
* max_features = None
* n_estimators = 50

Now, compared to the Naive Predictor below is the table showing the difference

|     Metric     |   Naive Predictor | Optimized Model |  Difference |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | :---------: | 
| Accuracy Score |            0.2478 |           0.8463|       0.5985|
| F-score        |            0.2917 |           0.6888|       0.3971|

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

**Answer:**

The five most important features according to me out of the 13 features in order are:
1. hours-per-week
2. capital-gain
3. age
4. occupation
5. education-level

Because the hours-per-week is directly related to the income as income is on hourly basis. After that the capital gains affect as you are not working constantly at it but once you work on it, it keeps on generating some amount of income regularly. So larger the capital gain, the higher would be your net income. Age is also a factor because a higher income also depends the amount of experience a person has. Occupation beacause some occupation may be simply highly rewarding than others. Then comes the education level as generally people with higher degrees are also paid higher.

### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
 - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
 - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.


```python
# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50,max_features=None,criterion='entropy')

model.fit(X_train,y_train)

# TODO: Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```


![png](output_47_0.png)


### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?
* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? 
* If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?

**Answer:**

From the features obtained using the *.features_importance_* and the features i believed were important, three features seem to be common namely:
* **capital-gain**
    
    As i mentioned in the previous answer, captial-gains is the passive income the person is earning from his investments or properties which obviously adds up to his active income, i.e. the salary he/she might be earning from their job. So it makes it an important factor in determining whether or not the person has captial gains or not.
* **age**
    
    Because a higher income also depends the amount of experience a person has.
* **hours-per-week**
    
    hours-per-week is directly related to the income as income is on hourly basis

But the order of the features, which i believed, has been completely different from the ones obtained using *.features_importance_*.
And the other two important features are:

* **marital_status**
    
    It is has been observed from the visualization that people with the marital status "*Married-civ-spouse*" are the most important ones in determining that there income is greater than $50,000
* **education_num**
    
    Instead of education_num, which represents the number of years one has spent for education i suggested education-level but from a data analyst's education number makes more sense numerically, as for education-level we might have to assign weights according to the order in which the level is increased. For example, a person with masters should be assigned larger weight than a person with bachelors and so on.

### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8469
    F-score on testing data: 0.6910
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8362
    F-score on testing data: 0.6695
    

### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection

* How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
* If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?

**Answer:**

The final model's accuracy is much affected, it reduced just by 1.26% while the F-score reduced by an absolute value of 0.0215. 
As evident from the numbers the accuracy and F-score is slightly affected but on the other hand the data has been reduced greatly giving a better training time with almost similar prediction results. So yes if training time would have been a factor, it would be wise to use reduced data for training with minimal loss on the accuracy and F-score front.
